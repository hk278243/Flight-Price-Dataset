Flight Price Prediction :-
The project "Flight Price Prediction" involves building a machine learning model to predict flight prices based on various features. Here's an overview based on the notebook content:

Data Handling and Preparation: The project begins by importing and cleaning the dataset, which includes features such as airline, source, destination, and other relevant columns. One-hot encoding is used to convert categorical features like airline, source, and destination into numerical format for model training.

Feature Engineering: The dataset is preprocessed using transformations like encoding to handle categorical data, ensuring the model can use these features effectively for prediction.

Model Building: The focus of the project appears to be using machine learning techniques (though the model specifics are not fully visible) to predict flight prices based on the transformed and cleaned data.

This project is likely aimed at identifying patterns in flight price fluctuations and predicting future prices based on various factors like airline, travel route, and possibly time-based features such as date or season.
